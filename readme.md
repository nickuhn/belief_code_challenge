Using a supplied .pdf of the proposed layout I created a functioning website that matches closely.

jQuery and normalize.css are the only two framework/libraries that I used. I started to use a grid system, but didn't like the constraint and found myself overwriting or not using most of the functionality.

jQuery was used due to the mostly static format of the site. Depending on how the actual implementation of neighborhoods and expanding them out was done, I would probably expand to an MV* framework such as Angular.js or React.

All but the neighborhood links work, taking you to various parts of the page or Seattle Tourism websites. The contact form submit, just throws up an alert with the info typed in and would be hooked in to a server or database call.

This entire process took me approximately two days. The youtube portions required the most time, researching the api and embedding.
